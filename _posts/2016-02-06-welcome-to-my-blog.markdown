**TL;DR: Welcome to my blog.**

Hi there. My name is Alex and this is my new blog. I don't believe that someone will actually read this, but I have to write the first article. In fact, I had something like 10 blogs before, and none of them succeeded; I wrote a couple posts, I claimed to properly blog over years. "This one will surely be the main one. The long-living one. The popelar one." Nah, I'm to lazy for this.

I don't know if I will give up after this post, but this blog will be hosted on Github, and I visit Github oftenly.
